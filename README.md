# Java/Spring/HTMX practice project

I have been working on different technologies for over 20 years. PHP, Javascript, Java, Clojure and most recent, Python.

Even though I did some Java, it was just for a couple of months and I have been willing to use a statically-typed
language for some time now. However, it's always difficult to find a job when you don't have experience with the
language, so I decided that instead of just reading some books, tutorials, videos, or other sources, I will build a 
side project using Java.

#### TL DR: I'm creating a project to practice Java and HTMX and document what I learned. Don't use it in real life.

### Why HTMX?
I happen to have a very strong opinion regarding the javascript and frontend direction for the past 6-7 years. I have
found over-engineered solutions to very simple problems that we never had in the JQuery era. I've tried React and Vue
and just got very frustrated on how complicated things are and how little benefit you get from using those tools other 
than getting hired in some full-stack position where you will kind of understand the front end and noticing that the
rest of the team also kind of understand how it works.

I heard of HTMX a couple of months ago and I loved the idea as soon as I read the documentation. Just go back to what
HTTP and HTML were meant from the beginning and build everything on the server. Use whatever backend language you prefer
and actually enjoy programming it.

If you have never heard of it, I recommend that you read this
[Hypermedia document](https://hypermedia.systems/introduction/).

### Why this project?

It's often difficult to choose a portfolio project that is not too small, or too big. Sure, a hospital can be VERY
large. However, it can be just a part of it and not the whole thing.

I also happen to be working on a project for a small Hospital that has very specific needs, so I can bring most of it
to his project and do both at the same time. I will be able to play and experiment here while solving a real life
problem.


## Disclaimer

This is not an application intended for real life use. It's mostly a therapy place for me that I can share with the
world as I LOVE programming, and it relaxes me to learn. I have never done something like what I have in mind for this
project.

## So, what is this about?

My idea is to have some kind of blog. At this point is to have log files when I push changes explaining what
I did along with the reasoning around my decision to do what I did. Maybe it can help someone to decide on a pattern or
tool to use.

If there is interest from a single person, I will add something to have discussions on my decisions as this will be a
learning experience for me. I will investigate if GitHub has something for this.

## What other tools will you use?

What I'm familiar with.

- Postgres
- Docker
- Bootstrap
- AWS CDK (initially. I might look into Terraform)

And I will add things as they are needed.
